The project is part of a course project in natural language processing. In this project, I created a global log-linear model for part-of-speech tagging of natural language in Python. The data came from Wall Street Journal. The goal of this project was to assign a part-of-speech tag for each word and punctuation from sentences. The result achieved 91.22% in F-score. In this project, I used Perceptron algorithm for parameter estimation (model training) which was in perceptron.py and wrote a testing file test.py for testing the performance of the model. I used the subprocess module in Python to pipe in the sentences to other scripts within my code to prevent writing result to files which has highly improved the efficiency.
